// Chapter Math expressions Familiar operators


// Wherever you can use a number, you can use a math expression. For example, you're
// familiar with this kind of statement.

var popularNumber = 4;

//But you can also write this.
var popularNumber = 2 + 2;
// You can also write:
//alert(2 + 2);


// % is the modulus operator. It doesn't give you the result of dividing one number by
// another. It gives you the remainder when the division is executed.
// If one number divides evenly into another, the modulus operation returns 0. In the
// following statement, 0 is assigned to the variable.

var whatsLeftOver = 10 % 3;
console.log(whatsLeftOver);

var whatsLeftOver = 9 % 3;
